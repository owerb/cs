    <h3><u>1. What is Robotics?</u></h3>
<p class="testone">  <strong>- Robotics is an Engineering and computer science combined in the field of robotics, <br> which deals with the creation, manufacturing, and use of robots. <br> The goal of robotics is to build intelligent machines that can help people in different ways. <br> There are many different types of robotics. </strong></p>

<h2><u>2. Do you agree with the prescence of Robotics in our life?</u></h2>
<p class="testone"><strong>- Yes. The prescence of Robotics in our life is really great. <br> It's a wonderful branch of Computer Science and engineering and is the gateway to our future.</strong></p>

<h2><u>3. Some of the Robotic types are:</u></h2>
<p class="testone"><strong>- Industrial Robots:  An industrial robot is a robot system used for manufacturing. Industrial robots are automated, <br>programmable and capable of movement.
   <br> - Military Robots: Most military robots are teleoperated and do not carry weapons; their functions include disarming explosive devices, sniper detection, reconnaissance, and surveillance. <br> The robots that are now outfitted with weapons are controlled remotely,<br> meaning they are unable to carry out independent killing.
   <br> - Medical Robots: A medical robot is a robot used in the medical sciences. <br> They include surgical robots. <br> These are in most tele manipulators, which use the surgeon's activators on one side <br>to control the effector on the other side.
    </strong> </p>

    

<h2><u>4. Two Robot types:</u></h2>

<img class="thirdimg" src="BotsAI.jpeg" alt="bots">

<p class="testone"><strong>1. An industrial robot is a production robot system. <br> Industrial robots can move on three or more axes, are automated, and can be programmed.
    <br> 2. Humanoids. While many mobile humanoid robots may technically fall under the domain of an AMR, <br> the term is used to identify robots that perform human-centric.
    </strong></p>


<h2><u>5. What are some effects of robots on humans?</u></h2>
<p class="testone"><strong>Robots are fabulous, they are both efficient and precise. They are the perfect workers, <br> but in person they are still friendly and interactable despite their uncomfortable human like <br> appearance humanoid type bodies that try and portray the common man but with emotionless <br> faces with a very weird demeanor but they are very intelligent.
</strong></p>

<h2><u>7. Pros and Cons of Robotics:</u></h2>
<p class="testone"><strong>The pros are simple manufacturing and medicine and surgery are more efficient and precise costing less money in the long run being more convenient for businesses and companies which is the future 
    On the other hand, the cons are that job opportunities are harder to find as well as peoples paychecks reduced for companiesâ€™ robotics is a pro but for normal average people, they are a huge con.</strong></p>
